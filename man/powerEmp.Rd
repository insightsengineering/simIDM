\title{Empirical Power for a List of Simulated Trials}
\usage{
powerEmp(simTrials, criticalPFS, criticalOS, eventNumPFS, eventNumOS)
}
\arguments{
\item{simTrials}{(\code{list})\cr simulated trial data sets, see \code{\link[=getClinicalTrials]{getClinicalTrials()}}.}

\item{criticalPFS}{(positive \code{number})\cr critical value of the log-rank test for PFS.}

\item{criticalOS}{(positive \code{number})\cr critical value of the log-rank test for OS.}

\item{eventNumPFS}{(\code{integer})\cr number of PFS events required to trigger PFS analysis.}

\item{eventNumOS}{(\code{integer})\cr number of OS events required to trigger OS analysis.}
}
\value{
This returns values of four measures of empirical power.
}
\description{
This function computes four types of empirical power — PFS, OS, at-least (significant
in at least one of PFS/OS), and joint (significant in both PFS and OS) — using
the log-rank test. Empirical power is calculated as the proportion of significant
results in simulated trials, each ending when a set number of PFS/OS events occur.
Critical values for PFS and OS test significance must be specified.
