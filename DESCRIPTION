Description: The package can be used to simulate a large number of
    clinical trials with oncology endpoints progression-free survival (PFS) and 
    overall survival (OS) using an illness-death model,
    see Meller, Beyersmann and Rufibach (2019) <doi:10.1002/sim.8295>. 
    The simulation set-up allows for random and event-driven censoring,
    an arbitrary number of treatment arms, staggered study entry and drop-out. 
    Exponentially, Weibull and piecewise exponentially 
    distributed survival times can be generated.
