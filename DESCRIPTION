Description: The package can be used to simulate a large number of
    clinical trials with oncology endpoints overall survival (OS) and
    progression-free survival (PFS).  The simulation is based on a
    survival multistate model that jointly models OS and PFS, i.e. an
    illness-death model is simulated. The simulation set-up allows for
    random and event-driven censoring, an arbitrary number of treatment
    arms and staggered study entry. Exponentially distributed, Weibull
    distributed and piecewise exponentially distributed survival times can
    be generated.
